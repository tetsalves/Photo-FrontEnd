Account Management
=======================

## How do I create an account?
Visit http://openphoto.me and click the Sign Up button. Select a username for your OpenPhoto site along with a password.

## How do I log in?
You can do this in two ways: through the main openphoto.me site or through your own site. Click Sign In, and then enter your email address and password.

## How can I retrieve a lost password?
Go to the Sign In page and click "Forgot Password" next to the password entry field. Enter the email address you signed up with and click Submit. You'll receive a link where you can reset your password.

## Can I change the email I signed up with? 
Not at this time, no. We're working on it.

## Can I change my password?
Yes. When you sign in, click "Forgot password?" and enter your email address. You'll get a link to reset your password as if you had forgotten it.

## How do I delete my account?
We're sad to see you go. Right now account deletion is manual, so email support@openphoto.me and we'll delete your account for you. Before you delete your account, make sure to migrate your photos to an external account that you control. You can do that at https://openphoto.me/migrate
