Photo Storage
=======================

## Where can I store my photos?
Right now OpenPhoto supports Amazon S3, Box.com, Dropbox, CX.com, and DreamHost DreamObjects.

## How do I switch where my photos are stored?
Visit http://openphoto.me/migrate while logged in, select where you'd like your photos to go, and follow the instructions.

## How can I import my photos?
You can import your photos through the Upload photos page when you're logged into OpenPhoto. At the bottom of the Upload photos page are links to import photos from Flickr, Facebook, and Instagram. Select the site(s) you'd like to import from and follow the instructions.

## Can I keep uploading to another photo site and have that photo automatically show up in OpenPhoto?
Not directly through OpenPhoto, but you can use sites like ifttt or Pi.pe that will automatically upload a picture to OpenPhoto when you upload a picture somewhere else (or vice versa).
